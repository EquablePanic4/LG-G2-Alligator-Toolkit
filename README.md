# LG-G2-Alligator-Toolkit
Toolkit which helps users in modding LG G2 phone

## This is the best application I have ever written
This program is my best application I've ever written... You may ask "why?", and I understand this question because this app isn't expand, there aren't any difficult alghorithms. This is simple program - with simple code, and it's also simply for users... and it's my first programming project - this is the reson why this app is so important for me.

## Story of Alligator Toolkit
### First version of Alligator Toolkit - Windows Batch Script
First version of this app was simple Windows Batch script, but this was powerfull script which enabled LG G2's users easily root and install custom firmware on their phones. App had only one language version - polish - and it was firstival published on polish forum - forum.android.com.pl : https://forum.android.com.pl/topic/160495-toolkitdev-acpllg-g2-alligator-toolkit-v31-31-sierpie%C5%84-2016/
It was huge success, this app had many users which simply liked to use this tool.

### Alligator Toolkit was translated to english by mlm1102003 from XDA Developers
I was very suprised when I found my toolkit on XDA with english translation - I didn't make this translation by myself because I didn't suspect that it can be huge successfull app. I'm very thankfull to mlm1102003, because he gave me so much motivation. Thank You! Below I attach fragment of our conversation.

### In next few days it was translated into russian and italian!
It was very suprising for me, but people from communities from whole world started translating my toolkit. It was only small project, but I'm still unable to not crying when I'm thinking about all of this...
> Hi Bartek,
> I'm Max from Italy!
> Could I help you in translating the TOOL in Italian?
> In Italy we are a great community so probably it can be profitable to translate it, right?
-> Maxximo88 (XDA Developers)

> Hi!
> This is russian translation of your Android Toolkit for LG G2. By me! )
-> J0HNSS0N (XDA Developers)

I mention you guys because you gave me much power, and it was the begining of my programmer career.

### But it also was stealed
I am happy that even germans wanted to steal my work. https://swedroid.se/forum/threads/official-hazard17s-lg-g2-toolkit-v1-5-windows.109153/ Autor of this post introduced him self as me. ðŸ¤£ I'm not angry it's funny for me that this app was so prestige that everyone wanted to be Alligator Toolkit's author. ðŸ˜‚

### Toolkit v2 - Delphi Engine
Second toolkit was better - it had closed source (written in Delphi and compiled) with less number of bugs. This version was just more user friendly - of course there also were 4 supported languages - polish, english, italian, russian.

### Toolkit v3.0 - .NET Engine and C# powered
This version of toolkit was revolutionary - now there was GUI (Win Forms) and it was very user friendly. This was my first big project in .NET - when I finished Toolkit (version 3.1 was the last one) I decided to continue learning .NET and C# (and it was best decision in my life). I'm terrified when I think that I could became for example Java Developer ðŸ˜µ. Source code of the last version is availble here. ðŸ™‚

### There are many tutorials for my app, not created by me
I'm very proud that people from whole world used my app, that people from whole world was writting tutorials based on my app!
